# Cloudflare Worker for Mongo Atlas webhooks sending to Discord

A Cloudflare Worker that converts Mongo Atlas webhooks into a Discord-friendly format.  
This worker receives incoming webhook payloads from Mongo Atlas, reformats them into a Discord message, and forwards the data to a Discord webhook.

## Features

- **Webhook Transformation:** Converts Mongo Atlas webhook payloads to a formatted Discord message.
- **TypeScript & Gulp:** Uses TypeScript for type safety and Gulp to build the project.
- **Cloudflare Worker:** Runs on Cloudflare's serverless platform.
- **Easy Configuration:** Manage settings via environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js (>=18)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) (or npm if preferred)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for Cloudflare Workers deployment

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:H47R15/cf-worker-for-atlas-discord-webhooks.git
   cd cd-wh-atlas-to-discord
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project (for local usage) with at least the following variable:

```dotenv
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_id/your_webhook_token
```

> **Note:** Cloudflare Workers do not automatically use your `.env` file. To securely set the Discord webhook URL in your deployment, use Wranglerâ€™s secret command as described below.

## Wrangler Installation

The Wrangler CLI is required for deploying Cloudflare Workers.

1. **Install Wrangler Globally via Yarn**

   ```bash
   yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**

   ```bash
   wrangler --version
   ```

3. **Login to Cloudflare**

   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

## Development

### Build with Gulp

The project uses Gulp to compile the TypeScript files.

- **To Build:**

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

  This command compiles the TypeScript source (from `main.ts`) into JavaScript in the `dist` folder.

### Running Locally

You can test your worker locally using Wrangler:

```bash
yarn start
```

This starts your Worker in a local development environment.

## Deployment

Before deploying, ensure you have set your Discord webhook secret in Cloudflare:

1. **Set the Discord Webhook Secret**

   Using Wrangler, run:
   
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```
   
   Follow the prompt to enter your Discord webhook URL (e.g., `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_id/your_webhook_token`).

2. **Deploy Your Worker**

   First, build your project:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   Then deploy it:

   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

Your worker will now be deployed to Cloudflare and will use the secret binding for `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`.

## Usage

Once deployed, configure your Mongo Atlas webhook to point to your Cloudflare Worker URL (e.g., `https://<your-worker-subdomain>.workers.dev`).  
The worker will parse the incoming Mongo Atlas payload, convert it to a Discord-friendly message, and forward it to your configured Discord webhook.

To test the worker manually, you can use the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-worker-subdomain>.workers.dev \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

If everything is working, you should get an "OK" response and see your message forwarded to Discord.
